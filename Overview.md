# So you want to start a tech leaders study group

Mazel tov! We did this in the fall of 2017. It was a great experience, and helped a lot of us brainstorm, problem-solve and figure out new priorities and goals. A lot of work went into making it the great experience it was. This document is designed to help you bootstrap a group of your own.

# Mission

Leadership is not a spot on the org chart, or a role someone can assign you, or a set of facts you can memorize.  Leadership is a muscle that every one of us must exercise.  You can either exercise 

### Basic logistics

* We met from 4-5:30pm on Sunday afternoons at a team member’s home. A fair amount of thought went into this: 
    * The setting seemed to encourage more intimacy than an office setting,
    * it did not take up a full weekend evening,
    * we didn't have to try and muster up our most relaxed, vulnerable selves at the end of a long work day, and
    * it let out before Game of Thrones started at 6.
* We initially met for six consecutive weeks, and required a commitment of at *least* four weeks
* We requested that people tuck away their phones, do a piece of homework and commit to being fully present.

### Things to keep in mind when choosing members

* Our sweet spot was around eight people, located within easy weekend-commuting distance of the meeting location (we invited 10 to participate, had 6-9 in attendance each week)
* Essential: the ability to keep confidentiality, high level of trustworthiness. Gossip leaking to third parties would’ve killed our fragile vibe stone dead
* Good to have: broad representation across race, age, orientation, gender, seniority, role. This contributed hugely to the richness of our discussions, see below
* Other considerations: don't invite people who work together.  Consider including a minority of straight white dudes.
* What we could’ve done better: less connected members took a while to figure out existing relationships. We should’ve started first meeting with introductions, eg: “I’m X, I’m here because Charity met me while standing in line for ice cream and convinced me to start my own aerospace company”

### Exercises we tried

* Homework: using the below diagram, we discussed where we were at in three broad areas: work, family and self. This turned out to be such an enormously effective icebreaker and meeting opener, we’re keeping it as we move to informal meetings.

* Role playing: we workshopped interviews by role-playing difficult candidates. Always a stimulating experience
* Asking peers about coping strategies: a lot of times, family and friends saw things very differently
* Accountability buddies: we paired off to work on specific personal challenges, and checked in with one another mid-week. A lot of us got huge tasks accomplished by virtue of this
* At the last meeting, our homework included extra questions: What did I learn? Where do I want to be in a year?

### Topics that came up for us

* Engineering management, including interviewing
* Running and facilitating meetings
* How to run technical projects with delegation, playing to strengths, etc
* Founder trauma
* Coping strategies/self care
* Recruiting
* Assertiveness

### What worked

* Candor, honesty, presence. Getting offline/silencing phones. Respect for the space. Meeting in a member’s home contributed to this, as did Charity’s care in selecting group members who would engage in this way
* Sharing perspectives across very different experience sets
* Asking questions rather than giving advice
* Giving each other the benefit of the doubt and assuming good faith
* Bringing home-cooked snacks

### Where we faced significant challenges

* Scheduling - everyone’s calendars were a nightmare, and one meeting fizzled because only 2-3 people showed up
* Less technical people felt a little self-conscious
* Less connected-with-the-group people felt very self-conscious, and we could have done a much better job of including them from the outset
