### Learned:

Super, super important to invite a team of people who are actively trying to level up in their careers, and who are making time in their life for this kind of thing right now.  It's *hard* to commit to this much time, this many weeks in a row.  It's also absolutely necessary to spend this much time together to get to know each other well enough to lower your guard and start to really share the hard shit.  I learned to ask for RSVPs and commitment.
